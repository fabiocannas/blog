Hello there! I’m Fabio Cannas, the writer of this blog. By profession, I am a cloud engineer with a particular interest in best practices on the Microsoft cloud platform and IAC. 
I work at an Italian consulting company called PA Expertise.

I’ve been participating in software development projects involving Microsoft technologies for almost a decade. I began my career by doing full-stack software development on Windows Server on-premises environments. However, for the past six years, I’ve worked purely with Microsoft cloud services. I design and implement different kinds of solutions for my customers, such as web applications, APIs, integrations and other background processes, and review solutions made by others for quality, cost optimization and security issues.

I hold the following certifications:

- Microsoft Certified: Azure Administrator Associate
- Microsoft Certified: Azure Solution Architect Expert
- Microsoft Certified: DevOps Engineer Expert
- Microsoft Certified: Azure Developer Associate
- Microsoft Certified: Fabric Analytics Engineer Associate
- Microsoft Certified Solutions Associate: Web applications
- Microsoft Certified Solutions Associate: App Builder
- Microsoft Certified Professional
			
### THIS BLOG

For a long time, I thought about setting up a work-related blog to share knowledge and help others. I use to read a lot of blogs at work when facing challenges at work. Many times, I’ve found valuable insights from others who have been in similar situations. However, there have been moments when I couldn’t find the information I needed, and that’s when I realized the importance of sharing my own experiences.

Before I set up this blog, the solutions lived only in my head/notes, or I shared them just with my closest colleagues. 
Today, this blog allows a much larger group of people to benefit from that information, and also serves as “thanks” to the community whose blogs have helped me in the past.

I hope you enjoy your stay here!

Fabio
